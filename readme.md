## What's this?

This is a full-stack application that I'm currently working on, where the end goal is an easy to use tool for learning new languages. The user is able to create flashcards for new words that they wish to memorize, and the app will keep track of when it is time to rehearse failed and passed cards, calculated on a customizeable spaced repetition algorithm.

## Have a look!

At the moment, there is no usable prototype, but I will update this readme as soon as there is!
